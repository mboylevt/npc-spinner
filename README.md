# npc-spinner
Used for spinning NPCs based on desired traits.  

## Usage 
There are two primary interfaces:
 * GET /npc - generates an NPC, query params for race, sex, archtype, and trait count
 * POST /npc_slack - Same as above but designed for Slack integration.  Returns the same data in slack-response format.
